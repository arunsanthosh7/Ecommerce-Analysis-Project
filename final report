# E-commerce Product Analytics Project – Final Report

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze Amazon product and category data from 2024 to extract meaningful insights that can help e-commerce managers, sales teams, and product strategists make data-driven decisions. The project focuses on cleaning raw data, exploring key metrics, and visualizing actionable insights using **SQL**, **Python (Pandas)**, and **Power BI**.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL**: Data extraction, filtering, and aggregation.
- **Python (Pandas)**: Data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **CSV Data**: Amazon product and category datasets (2024).

---

## Data Sources
1. **Amazon Products CSV** – contains product-level details such as:
   - Product ID, Name, Category, Price, Rating, Reviews, Stock
2. **Amazon Categories CSV** – contains category-level details:
   - Category ID, Name, Parent Category, Number of Products

**Note:** Raw datasets were large (350 MB for products) and were preprocessed for analysis.

---

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Extraction (SQL)
- Extracted required columns from large CSV files using SQL queries.
- Performed initial filtering to remove irrelevant or incomplete records.
- Removed duplicate entries to ensure clean datasets.

**Example Queries:**
```sql
SELECT product_id, product_name, category, price, rating, reviews
FROM amazon_products
WHERE price IS NOT NULL;

**Example Queries:**
```sql
SELECT product_id, product_name, category, price, rating, reviews
FROM amazon_products
WHERE price IS NOT NULL;

### 2. Data Cleaning & Transformation (Python Pandas)

- Handled missing values and standardized column names.
- Converted data types for easier analysis (e.g., `price` to numeric, `rating` to float).
- Removed duplicates and outliers for more accurate insights.
- Merged product and category datasets for enriched analysis.
# Remove duplicates
products_df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

# Convert price to numeric
products_df['price'] = pd.to_numeric(products_df['price'], errors='coerce')

# Merge datasets
merged_df = pd.merge(products_df, categories_df, on='category_id', how='left')


### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzed product distribution across categories.
- Identified top-selling products based on reviews and ratings.
- Calculated average price, rating, and review count per category.
- Detected trends, patterns, and anomalies.

**Insights:**
- Electronics and Home & Kitchen were the categories with the most products.
- Premium categories had higher average ratings but fewer products.
- Products with moderate pricing (₹500–₹2000) had the highest sales volume.

---

### 4. Data Visualization (Power BI)

- Created interactive dashboards to present key insights:
  - **Category-wise Product Count**
  - **Price Distribution by Category**
  - **Top 10 Rated Products**
  - **Revenue Potential by Category**
- Dashboards allow decision-makers to filter by category, rating, and price range.

**Dashboard Features:**
- Interactive slicers for category and price range.
- Charts: Bar, Line, Pie, and Scatter plots.
- KPI cards for quick summary of metrics.

---

### Key Findings
1. **Category Performance:** Electronics and Fashion had the highest number of products but varied in average ratings.
2. **Pricing Trends:** Mid-range priced products showed higher demand.
3. **Customer Ratings:** Highly-rated products (4.5+ stars) contributed significantly to revenue potential.
4. **Opportunity Areas:** Some categories, like Health & Wellness, had fewer products but high customer engagement, indicating a growth opportunity.
